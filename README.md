# Quantum Art Gallery (QAG)

A decentralized platform merging quantum physics, blockchain technology, and digital art to create unique, verifiable artistic experiences.

## Overview

Quantum Art Gallery (QAG) is a groundbreaking platform that leverages quantum entanglement phenomena to generate and authenticate digital art pieces. The system combines blockchain technology for ownership verification and quantum random number generators (QRNG) to create truly unique artistic experiences.

## Core Components

### Quantum Art Generation

- **Quantum Entropy Source**: Integration with IBM Quantum computers for generating true random numbers
- **Art Generation Algorithm**: Converts quantum measurements into visual elements using custom neural networks
- **Entanglement Verification**: Cryptographic proofs ensuring the quantum origin of each piece

### Blockchain Infrastructure

- **Smart Contracts**: Ethereum-based contracts managing:
    - Art piece ownership and transfer rights
    - Curator voting mechanisms
    - Revenue distribution
    - Gallery theme proposals
- **NFT Implementation**: ERC-721 compliant tokens representing:
    - Individual art pieces
    - Curator rights
    - Gallery participation rights

### Experience Platform

- **VR Gallery**: Immersive virtual reality environment for experiencing quantum art
- **AR Integration**: Mobile AR features for displaying art in real-world contexts
- **Real-time Quantum Feed**: Live integration with quantum computers for dynamic art evolution

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contract Structure

```solidity
contract QuantumArtGallery {
    struct ArtPiece {
        uint256 id;
        bytes32 quantumHash;
        address artist;
        uint256 curatorScore;
    }
    
    struct CuratorRights {
        address curator;
        uint256 votingPower;
        uint256 reputationScore;
    }
    
    mapping(uint256 => ArtPiece) public artPieces;
    mapping(address => CuratorRights) public curators;
}
```

### Quantum Data Integration

```python
class QuantumDataProcessor:
    def __init__(self, ibm_quantum_connection):
        self.quantum_connection = ibm_quantum_connection
        
    def generate_quantum_entropy(self):
        # Connect to quantum computer
        # Generate random quantum states
        # Measure and return results
        
    def verify_entanglement(self, art_piece_data):
        # Verify quantum signatures
        # Validate entanglement proofs
```

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/quantum-art-gallery/QAG.git
cd QAG
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
